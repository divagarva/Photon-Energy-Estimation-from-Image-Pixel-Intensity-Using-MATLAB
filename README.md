# Photon-Energy-Estimation-from-Image-Pixel-Intensity-Using-MATLAB
 This MATLAB project estimates photon energy from image pixel intensities by mapping grayscale values to corresponding wavelengths. Using Planck's equation, the photon energy is calculated for each pixel, providing insight into the energy distribution of the captured light in an image.
